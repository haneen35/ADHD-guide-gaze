# <b>description of prototype: </b>

<br>The prototype is a smart communication system operated using Arduino and Python technologies. The first part of the prototype involved the Webcam, the main input source for visual data required for eye detection, which was connected directly to the laptop using a USB port. Regarding the second part of the prototype which acted as the receiver and responsive part of the system, two circuits were built. The first circuit connected the relay module to the Arduino UNO board, shown in table (2). 
The second circuit connected the red LEDs to the relay module and power supply, shown in table 3. To simulate the classroom setting, a wooden stand was built. Two large rectangular pieces of wood were used to represent the board and the base. The top wooden piece was fixed on the base using cut triangular wooden pieces, which were cut using the laser cutter in Maadi STEM Fab-Lab. The red LEDs were fixed on the top wooden piece. The wooden base carried all the electronic components, shown in figure (1). The webcam was put on a farther distance from the stand to simulate the distance between the studentâ€™s desk and the whiteboard, which was about 1 meter. The total cost was 80 Egyptian pounds.
